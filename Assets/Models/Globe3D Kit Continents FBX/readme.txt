high definition and very clean models

simple and comprehensive nomenclature (see the summary info provided below)


The Package includes 3 .Max files, 3 .3ds files and an illustrator7 file


• Continents flat meshes ready for extrusion with global cylindrical UVW coordinates compatible with geographical map you can find on internet (see example)

• continents extruded with global UVW coordinates compatible with geographical map you can find on internet (see example)  

-> Max version polygonal comes with differents materials ID (front faces, Sides faces and back faces) so you can adjust colors, visibility or whatever for each part

-> 3DS version : extruded continents : 'FrontFaces' + 'SideFaces' + 'BackFaces' =  the 3 differents materials ID are converted to 3 separated  meshes (for easy materials changes)
-> or extruded continents : 'Ground-Z1' + 'Ground-Z2' + 'Ground-Z3' (separated in 3 parts for .3ds format export)
